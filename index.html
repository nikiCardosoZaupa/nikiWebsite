            <h2>context</h2>
            <p>as of now i'm focusing on 2 different organic "materials" to convey the idea of life and death. algae and mould. in my studio project proposal i noted how i would like my work to be a tryptic in order to contextualise how life and death are constituted by an interrelation between each other. i agree that this need to be explored further to justify it's own being. my points are that the choice of a tryptic comes from religion, where the number 3 is often viewed as a symbol of interrelation between different elements (triple goddess in wicca, holy trinity in christianity, the three pure ones in taoism and many more). i want this work to have symbolic connotations, and i want symbology to be a central part of how this work is perceived. the three parts can be seen as 3 totems, of life, death and cyclicity. </p>
            <p>i think it's needed to say that my dissertation will explore themes of (lack of) structures of support, capitalistic exploitation, environmental crisis. how death and life are perceived from a political point of view, hence the need of the religious connotations, because religion has much influence in how we construct our social systems. i would argue that religion is a form of proto-politics, because it can be theorized that the birth of politics comes along the birth of the cemetery. so in a way i make no real difference between religion and politics, the religious nature of the work is more a way to suggest the primeval essence of religion as a starting point for politics. </p>
            <p>i think that eventually the 3 totems should lead one another in harmony, or at least i would like to suggest how each influences the other. i don't really know yet how i'd do that, but my guess is that computation shall be the maker of this connection. each of the 3 totems will have different materials, different outputs but, because they're finished objects, they can be quantified in numbers. that's why computation could come in handy. of course computation will be used in other ways to construct these totems as well, each with it's own set of rules and systems, but i'm also interested in a computational part that gathers each totem's output to influence the others.</p>
            <p>​to get back to the material choice, to the algae and the mould. why is algae the symbol of life? algae is believed to be the oldest complex form of life of the planet Earth. bacteria is known to be the oldest form of life, but i won't be working with it because it would just be too complicated. algae instead offers some "simplicity" in how it can be handled and experienced. it comes from salty water, which is the culturing media par excellence. at one point in the planet, every life form came to be thanks to this mixture of salts and minerals and chemicals. algae is also the actual major contributor of oxygen alongside dryland's plants, actually, algae produces up to 80% of the Earth's oxygen reserves (not all of it leaves the water's surface, but that's the gist of it). the particular algae i would work with is a bioluminescent algae, meaning that it can emanate light, and this reinforces the idea of a living organism (again, religion comes up: often life - or life giving deity - is pictured as a form of light). despite me saying that algae are "simple" to work with, they really aren't all things considered. the water needs to be of a specific Ph, the salinity needs to be at a precise percentage - and it can't be table salt! a range of salts are present in seawater - the temperature needs to be in a specific range without too much swing, the light conditions need to be optimal, not to mention: growing these organisms required some good deal of housekeeping, otherwise bacteria won't think twice about simply overtaking and eating them away, so the culture vessel needs to be sterile. in other words, algae, like life, need care. systems of support must be put in place for its maintenance, and balance must be kept under control to allow for flourish.</p>
            <p>mould instead is the symbol of death. once the right amounts of proteins and moisture are left to rot, mould develops with ease. every organic thing will eventually mould, because mould is the main actor in place for decomposition, for giving back what was borrowed from the Earth. mould, differently from the algae, does not really need "care", it instead thrives because of the lack of it, because it will eventually arrive. energy must be spent if one wishes to destroy it - a useless expense, given that it will arrive again soon after. in this way, the mould reminds me of a memento mori, a sign of unstoppable decay. of entropy towards simple form: decomposition leads the organic to become mineral salts, water, sugars and carbon dioxide, so that it can be repurposed to feed another birthing lifeform. mould is also often seen as bio-degradation. some black and brown moulds eat through the wood in our homes, making them weaker. mould doesn't need care, or balance, it needs acknowledgement. i'll talk about black mould in social housing in my dissertation to emphasize how a lack of care for life leads to an imbalance, and the growth of the toxic element. </p>
