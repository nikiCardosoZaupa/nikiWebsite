            <h2>totem of life: Dinoflagellates</h2>
            <p>dinoflagellates is a superclass of organisms (microalgae) quite present all around the world. in my dissertation i'll explore them by talking about environmental issues, in particular 
                about the so called harmful algal blooms (HAB). an harmful algal blooms usually occurs when the high temperatures allow for overgrowth of these organisms, mixed with a uncontrolled use 
                of fertilizer - which get carried in the coast by rivers. the most popular HAB is said to be the Red Tide in the Gulf of Mexico, which every year causes great detriment to the marine 
                health present along the coasts of Florida, Texas and Mexico. that's because the main organism responsible for these red tides is the Karenia Brevis, a single-celled photosynthetic 
                organism of the genus Karenia.</p>
            <p>K. Brevis is widely popular along the east coast of America, and when at bay it doesn't represent much of a threat, but when blooming it colours the waters red with its over-presence 
                (hence the name Red Tides). K. Brevis releases a neurotoxin called brevetoxin, which in high concentration can be extremely harmful to the local fauna. the brevetoxin can also be harmful 
                to humans if molluscs full of the toxin are to be ingested, leading to neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. moreover, the blooms can also be harmful to people with respiratory conditions, 
                also leading to eye and skin irritations. </p>
            <p>K. Brevis, alongside a multitude of species of dinoflagellates, can also produce bioluminescence, leading to spectacular displays of blue light in the waters at night. bioluminescence has 
                a variety of functions in the animal kingdom, but in this case it's mainly viewed as a "burglar alarm", a way for the algae to alert bigger predators when an algae's predator approaches. 
                the burglar alarm hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the bioluminescence triggers in a peculiar way - mechanical friction, suggesting that when a K. Brevis' predator enters the 
                bloom it will lead to a formation of a trace of itself, allowing other bigger predators to chase it down.</p>
            <p>of course i will not work with karenia brevis for my final year's project. the main issue is with its toxicity, the second issue is about importing an organism native to the US here in Scotland. 
                dinoflagellate is a enormously varied superclass, and luckily there are a few options - some of them are even local.</p>

        <section class="section paragraph">

            <p>L. Polyedra and P. Lunula are quite interesting organisms for my purpose because 1) they are found globally, 2) they are not toxic in the same way as K. Brevis is, 
                3) their bioluminescence is triggered in the same way as the K. Brevis does and 4) they are also responsible for algal blooms alongside K. Brevis. worth mentioning that 
                L. Polyedra is also able to produce toxins called yessotoxins, which accumulate in molluscs and can be harmful to humans if those molluscs are then ingested. both L. Polyedra 
                and P. Lunula can be easily found in the UK, both in coasts and in labs, and although i'd love to go on an expedition to find these algae armed with a microscope and a 
                small boat, getting them from a lab is much safer and less expensive. a couple years ago i already tried culturing L. Polyedra at home. due to negligence, my specimen died 
                and was replaced by a common green algae. darn. the specimen costed me £30 so this time i opted for the much cheaper Pyrocystis Lunula (£17). P. Lunula also has no known 
                toxicity of any kind. both these specimens are purchased from Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP), the leading labs in the UK for these kind of things - they are based in 
                Oban.</p>
            
            <p>Pyrocystis Lunula is called like that because of it's shape, resembling a half moon. it differentiates only morphologically from Pyrocystis Fusiformis, but fundamentally 
                they are the same organism.</p>

            <p>like all dinoflagellates, P. Lunula feeds on nitrate, phosphate, trace metals, and vitamins. it thrives at temperatures between 16 and 25C, needing a full spectrum light in order to 
                photosynthesize. it is known to be quite forgiving, if one can handle a houseplant, they can also handle a P. Lunula with the right care. there's a few resources online to help growing it, 
                along with a few different media options (in this case the word medium refers to the mix of nutrients that help the algae grow). </p>
            <p>eventually i'd like to get back to L. Polyedra, but for now i want to use the P. Lunula to lead some early experiments because of its resilience.</p>
            <p>​​the medium of choice for my first time growing Lunula is a vial of L1 medium complete with sea salts. the L. Polyedra i've tried to grow before was purchased also alongside some L1 medium, 
                but i purchased the single components to DIY the medium and, given that i don't own an autoclave, that was probably why i got so much contamination. an autoclave sterilises nutrients without 
                the need to add heat, it does so by applying pressured steam. this means that vitamins can be sterilised, as the heat would denature and destroy them.</p>
            <p>for the Lunula i instead opted for an easier approach: each vial makes 1 litre of full-fledged medium ready to use. all i had to do was purchase some de-ionised water to avoid 
                over-presence of various minerals. I bought that water from a random retailer, so I'll still have to boil it for about 15 minutes to ensure sterility.</p>

            <p>I could make my own de-ionised water at home by building a rudimentary distilling device, but to be honest the cost of gas used would surpass the cost of just buying a few litres online. i also 
                wanted to experiment with another medium, this time without sea salts, so to be used with either natural or artificial sea water. this is more to test water quality. i went to Ayr, West Kilbride 
                and Arran and collected some salt water from the coast. NOTE: this is not how saltwater should be collected, as it's well known that the coast water is much more polluted. NOTE: eventually ended

            <p>the sample of P. Lunula I received was around 30ml. when transferring the samples to some new medium there are some rules to keep in mind. the culture should be added in 10% increments, 
                so 10ml of culture should be added into 100ml of medium. the medium itself should be kept at room temperature. as mentioned before, i will use 2 different types of medium, one pre-mixed by CCAP,
                and one mixed by myself. this is the recipe I followed from CCAP in order to make my own medium (the recipe is for making 1l, but I'll instead make 1.5l so I'll multiply accordingly):
                    <br><br><br>NaNO3 (Sodium nitrate) - 75g; 
                    <br><br>NaH2PO4.2H2O (Sodium dihydrogen phosphate) - 5.65g
                    <br><br>trace elements: these ase 11 chemicals that come premixed in a mediumVial - 8.88g
                    <br><br>a vitamin mix containing Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12), Biotin and ThiamineHCl (Vitamin B1) - 1g
                    </p>

            <p>the culture vessel should be clear, to allow for light and also to allow me to actually assess how the culture is doing. i opted for a couple of olives jars. eventually i'll move the culture 
                to a more appropriate vessel, but for my home experiments these will do just fine.</p>
            
            <p>the light cycle will be controlled for a couple of reasons: the main reason has to do with how the bioluminescence in these microalgae work. they emit the blue light only during the night. 
                this is probably because that's when the algae rises to surface (in a normal sea setting) to come in contact with oxigen. it's a bit more complicated than that, but this bioluminescence works 
                with 3 factors: the algae produces luciferase enzyme and luciferin molecule inside of a structure called scintillion. luciferase is produced similarly to chlorophyll, and it reacts with the luciferin 
                whenever there's some environmental stress. when friction, for example, is applied to the dinoflagellate's cell, its membrane becomes weaker, activating a series of chemical reactions. oxygen seeps 
                through the outer membrane of the cell, the scintillion becomes more acidic, and the luciferase accelerates the binding of luciferin with oxigen. the chemical reaction produces oxyluciferin, 
                generating light as a bioproduct.</p>

                <figcaption>An image from the paper <i>New Perspectives Related to the Bioluminescent System in Dinoflagellates: Pyrocystis lunula, a Case Study.</i> What's shown here is the chemistry behind
                            the process of bioluminescence. Their explanation goes as follows: The scintillons contain the luciferin, the LCF and,in some species, LBP. The scintillons are organelles which, during dark hours,are distributed 
                            around the periphery of the cell. A ﬂash of light is induced by an action potential along the membrane of the vacuole, trigger by a mechanical stimulus of the cell, and involving of a
                            voltage-dependent proton channel. This produce a reduction in pH (i.e., from 8.0 to near 6.0) within the scintillons, which activates the LCF and causes the LBP to release the luciferin,
                            making it available for oxidation by LCF. After full stimulation during the dark period, a single cell of P. lunula emits approximately 4 trillion photons, which is an order of magnitude 
                            greater than the light emitted by Pyrodinium bahamense and L. Polyedra.</figcaption>

            <p>i divided my sample into 2 vessels, 15ml of it in each vessel. i prepared the vessels by carving a 1/8 inch hole and covering it with a piece of cloth. this allows oxygen in while also protecting 
                the water from any falling bacteria. eventually that piece of cloth should be substituted by some parafilm tape. the full-spectrum light is placed above and besides the vessels. if the light is 
                too low it might overheat my cultures, killing the dinoflagellates, if it's too far up it won't give them enough light. above you can see how i configured my improvised "growing facility". <br>i 
                thought that my method was a bit too DIY, so i was initially worried i wouldn't get much out of it, but after 2 weeks my cultures have acclimated to the light cycles, and are now thriving. when i 
                say that they needed to acclimate themselves to the light cycles i really mean it. exhibitions do tend to take place during daylight hours, meaning that i can't have a piece that only shows it's 
                potential only during the night. to remediate that, i tricked the algae to think that the day is night, and the night is day. because the bioluminescence is strictly linked to circadian rhythms, 
                now the algae do emit light only during the day. i was so happy to see that my P. Lunula is growing happily, and the unique blue colour that it emits is truly fascinating.</p>

            <h2> considerations</h2>

            <p>these first few months have been mostly spent around caring for the Lunulas. of course I've been thinking about what actually can be done with them, but ensuring a proper environment for their 
                growth was simply too crucial. the notion of time, or maybe we could even just call it entropy, assumes a rather different and somewhat dangerous connotation, and it forces me to think of the work 
                holistically rather than step by step. i can't deny that often i found myself quite scared of taking some big steps (IE mixing my own medium or propagating the cultures) just because of the potential
                implications.<br><br> this new forced prospective was something i find quite interesting. often my process was about trying small things, prototyping, failing and re-doing - and of course i consider all 
                that fundamental, but there are also some ethical implications i cannot ignore. yes, P. Lunula is an invasive specie, yes it can become toxic for the local fauna affecting small bivalve and other 
                smaller scavenger animals, but it is still an organism. to be totally honest, i'm not really concerned in that sense on a surface level, but the principle still remains and i shouldn't ignore it.<br><br>
                the more i look into these algae, the more i see how the bioluminescence is the product of suffering, and how they exhaust themselves over time. this doesn't only have logistical implications (to 
                put it briefly, there will be the need of something that will control for how long the algae will be stimulated) but obvious ethical implications too, there's an exploitation taking place. this is 
                probably what led me to think about the work with a religious connotation too, the algae is a sacrificial lamb, perhaps catharsis? or fetish in a freudian sense?<br><br> catharsis is a word that came to my mind 
                very often when thinking about these things, and perhaps why i chose the algae as a way to symbolise life. the blue spectrum is the one which travels the most under water, and outside of the water
                assumes this strange and striking blue-green tone, the light to me is a sort of 'indicator' of life given that it's a primitive form of communication. i believe that this work should be paired with should
                to further emphasize the notion of a present, living, being. i don't know if i'm clear enough, the algae needs to make itself present in the work, and by doing so that's where the celebration happens, the 
                cathartic action of (in a way) screaming out of pain to describe the event of exploitation.<br>i'm aware that this is somewhat cruel, and i'm taking as many steps as possible to ensure that the 
                algae are at least living in favorable conditions.</p>

            <h2>triggering bioluminescence on demand</h2>

            <p>while my algae is growing happily, i can focus on what to do with it. if motion triggers the light, then i figured that a system should use some kind of motion factor, as this opens up a range of 
                possibilities. main idea at the moment revolves around constructing a grid of some sorts, and then map in some interaction that provokes the single cells in the grid to produce motion. adding 
                interaction brings the visitors in the work, putting them in front of the implications i mentioned before. this also means other things tho: it forces the work to be catered for such interaction, 
                adding that humanist touch that, personally, i'm not a big fan of. lol we will probably have to talk about this but not for now.</p>
            <p>this is not the first time i work with water. in year 2 i built a chladni-water-thing that would use a contact speaker in order to create chladni patterns according to some data about the Beaufort Gyre.
                i decided to maybe revisit that idea as it was quite aesthetically pleasing and easy to experiment with. I want to bring it up a notch tho, by incorporating a grid system.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="section paragraph">

            <p>the grid would work as follows: <br><br>a leap motion sensor or ML image detection will map the hand of a visitor. the position of the hand and some gestures are captured and translated into 
                signal. the data is then sent to a microcontroller (arduino based), which in turn will send it to the corresponding speaker - the position of the hand will declare which speaker needs to be 
                activated. the grid of speakers, which is put in contact with the tray containing the algae, will then put some motion in the water through cymatics, and that will prompt the algae to 
                illuminate accordingly.</p>
            <p>things to research:
                <br><br>- are speakers correct, or should i rely on more powerful (and cheaper) vibration motors? or should they be piezo contact speakers?
                <br><br>- what material should the tray be? is a square grid even correct or does that add unwanted tension which would distort the vibrations (because of the 90 degree angles)?
                <br><br>- should a leap motion or a webcam with ML be used? the leap motion works well in a low light settings, so in my opinion it seems like the safest route.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="section paragraph">

            <p>i decided to try and envision a way to trigger each speaker in software. this would help me put a clear image to the idea, and with that i can already start thinking about methods of interaction. 
                before starting my project, i was considering the mechanics of it too. let's say a visitor would put their hand in one place, and then shift it to another place, how is that shifting reflected 
                exaclty? and also, how do i handle the 'attack', as in, when a visitor puts their hand on the sensor for the first time, should there be a gradual ramp-up in the signal, or a burst? these questions
                might seem trivial, but given that a certain amount of friction has to be achieved, perhaps short, strong bursts would be more useful than a pleasant smoothening.</p>
            <p>my software of choice for prototyping ideas is touchdesigner, a node-based environment useful for handling data and allowing communications between other different software and hardware. it also has
                a 3d engine, which while it's not the best (mostly good for instancing), is good enough to run some simple visual simulations. because both channel and texture data can be put in relation with ease 
                in the same space, i can already start proposing some methods of how the numerical data should be named, parsed and quantized for a proper experience.</p>

         <section class="section paragraph">

            <p>the above image shows how i parse the data coming from the leap motion (it wasn't connected when i took this screenshot). the leapmotion sends a floating signal that ranges between -200 and 200, 
                although there need to be an excessive distance from the sensor to reach those values. for this prototype i'll scale down the range to be -100 to 100. i'll quantize it to be from -1 to 1 using 
                a MATH CHOP, and use a LIMIT CHOP to make sure it doesn't exceed that range. the channels for each vector (X,Y,Z), the grabbing gesture and the signal indicating that the hand is detected are all 
                merged together for house-keeping purposes. this gives me a clear node to reference if i need all those channels.

            <p>the first network is quite simple, it was useful in order to adjust my ranges in the data-parsing section, but at the end of the day it just consists of a sphere translating in the X and Z axis 
                according to the channels of the leapmotion. by starting from this, i can already decide on grid dimensions in the 3d space too (by following the UV coordinates of the grid and the sphere's position), 
                which will be useful later in a instancing scenario.</p>
