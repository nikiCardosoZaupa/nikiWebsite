            <p>so............. we know we want to stress this algae using air, we know that we shouldn't go for the mouldy membrane idea, it's far too risky and generally difficult to both make and exhibit.
                i know that i want the stressor to be something that acts at intervals, to express cyclical motion. I tried to expose the p. lunula to vibrations, but it didn't work. my setup was fairly simple, 
                a aluminum dish sitting on top of a subwoofer: the algae wasn't responding in a way that felt effective. yes I would see some random bursts of light, but the vibrations seemed to offer something 
                still too weak and controlled. what i found - and maybe this is because my samples were still fairly young when i tried - is that the p. lunula needs a *strong* amount of friction in order to 
                activate continuously. cymatic patterns do exercise a moderate amount of motion in the water AS THEY FORM, but once formed they tend to reach a point of stability, hence not stimulating the 
                algae anymore.overall, this realization was quite sad. using chladni patterns would have been elegant. i experimented with other stimulation methods: shaking the jar, for example, leads to 
                impressive results, but it tends to exhaust the algae pretty quickly - i believe it's because the reaction needs a few chemicals to interact with one another, and while a vigorous shake does 
                allow that, it also displaces them, making it so that subsequent stimulations are weaker. I also experimented using citric acid. using a dropper I'd hit the algae-water surface periodically. the 
                effect is indeed impressive, because it makes me think of some kind of magic rain. the algae definitely doesn't like citric acid. it's because the acid weakens the single cells' barriers 
                (think of it as corrosion), so in a way we're forcing the luciferin to come into contact with the oxygen by opening it's gate. this solution sure can look interesting (because you can see the 
                droplets hitting the algae very clearly), but it would be a temporary solution, as eventually the algae will die quickly due to the water's PH change. I wouldn't opt for this because it would 
                completely deplete my algae reserve. maybe a video could be done.
            </p>

            <p>the option that fascinates me the most now has something to do with all of the previous methods. I was looking into some options to oxygenate the water more. this would help once my batches grow 
                in size because eventually 1) the algal presence will obscure the light coming into the jars, keeping things in motion would expand the total surface area exposed to light simply by mixing the 
                cells around 2) the algae tend to attach to the container they’re in, again some motion would prevent that. 3) bigger batches of algae means a lot more water. the more water is added in a 
                container, the less total oxygen in the water can circulate. it’s common aquarium knowledge that a aquarium pump serves a few purposes: oxygenating the water and keeping the debris from attaching 
                to the aquarium surface.
            </p>

            <p>experimenting with a aquarium pump showed me that there are a few benefits in regards to my work: oxygenation, first of all, will aid the growth and overall health of the algae. the bubbles also 
                exercise ENOUGH abrupt motion to stimulate them briefly. the nature of the bubbles also makes them disperse semi-randomly, which is very appreciated by both me and the p. lunula. ALSO, something 
                worth noting is that the bubbles still do create a specific sound: the container they’re in vibrates very slightly, and these vibrations should be used.
            </p>

            <p>Using the bubbles is what I mean by developing around the organisms, rather than inserting them somewhere. it was a solution I would have had to deal with anyways because at my next propagation 
                I’ll have to use very big jars, and i’m excited to see that a “maintenance” solution also can become a “stimulation” solution.
            </p>

            <p>in the 2024 I had the luck of helping out and attending the Venice Biennale (I was a projector technician there). one of the works that surprised me the most was the work in the italian pavillion 
                (extremely rare circumstance!) by Caterina Barbieri, in collaboration with a few organ-building institutions. the work was all about the organs and the ability of air to transport information 
                through vibration. a ‘main’ organ pipe was placed in a room. speakers located at the corners of the room would emit a certain low frequency that would allow the organ pipe to successively vibrate. 
                in another room, other organ pipes (their size was a fraction of the main pipe) would respond to these main vibrations, hence emitting their own frequency too.
            </p>

            <p>a few things worth noting about Barbieri’s piece: there’s a mathematical equation that determines the relationship in size between the main pipe, the smaller pipes, and the “main frequency”. the 
                sound is transmitted through air, so long as the equation is respected, but the differing dimensions of the pipes allow for harmonics of the “main frequency”. the piece itself is all about 
                frequency and intercommunication, and it inspired me largely.
            </p>

            <p>I’d like to explore the concept of air and frequency and intercommunication. i find that air is a nice element to couple with water due to both being a fluid, and most times behaving similarly. 
                i believe that the specific frequency emitted by the bubbles in a not-full container can be harnessed, IF it has a relation with a container that completely encapsulates both the container with the 
                algae and the bubbles themselves.
            </p>

            <p>to put it in practical terms, I’d like to have a “algae container” consisting of a cylinder. another, larger and empty cylinder would contain the algae container. a aquarium pump would then be 
                inserted in the algae container. the expected outcome would be that, so long as the algae container and the external container (which we call pipe, for ease) have a relation in terms of 
                dimensions, volume and border thickness, a specific sound will be transported and emitted by the pipe. another evolution where this could be taken would involve a system that lowers or rises the 
                algae container vertically, modulating the pitch.</p>
