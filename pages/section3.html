            <p>so............. we know we want to stress this algae using air, we know that we shouldn't go for the mouldy membrane idea, it's far too risky and generally difficult to both make and exhibit.
                i know that i want the stressor to be something that acts at intervals, to express cyclical motion. I tried to expose the p. lunula to vibrations, but it didn't work. my setup was fairly simple, 
                a aluminum dish sitting on top of a subwoofer: the algae wasn't responding in a way that felt effective. yes I would see some random bursts of light, but the vibrations seemed to offer something 
                still too weak and controlled. what i found - and maybe this is because my samples were still fairly young when i tried - is that the p. lunula needs a *strong* amount of friction in order to 
                activate continuously. cymatic patterns do exercise a moderate amount of motion in the water AS THEY FORM, but once formed they tend to reach a point of stability, hence not stimulating the 
                algae anymore.overall, this realization was quite sad. using chladni patterns would have been elegant. i experimented with other stimulation methods: shaking the jar, for example, leads to 
                impressive results, but it tends to exhaust the algae pretty quickly - i believe it's because the reaction needs a few chemicals to interact with one another, and while a vigorous shake does 
                allow that, it also displaces them, making it so that subsequent stimulations are weaker. I also experimented using citric acid. using a dropper I'd hit the algae-water surface periodically. the 
                effect is indeed impressive, because it makes me think of some kind of magic rain. the algae definitely doesn't like citric acid. it's because the acid weakens the single cells' barriers 
                (think of it as corrosion), so in a way we're forcing the luciferin to come into contact with the oxygen by opening it's gate. this solution sure can look interesting (because you can see the 
                droplets hitting the algae very clearly), but it would be a temporary solution, as eventually the algae will die quickly due to the water's PH change. I wouldn't opt for this because it would 
                completely deplete my algae reserve. maybe a video could be done.
            </p>

            <p>the option that fascinates me the most now has something to do with all of the previous methods. I was looking into some options to oxygenate the water more. this would help once my batches grow 
                in size because eventually 1) the algal presence will obscure the light coming into the jars, keeping things in motion would expand the total surface area exposed to light simply by mixing the 
                cells around 2) the algae tend to attach to the container they’re in, again some motion would prevent that. 3) bigger batches of algae means a lot more water. the more water is added in a 
                container, the less total oxygen in the water can circulate. it’s common aquarium knowledge that a aquarium pump serves a few purposes: oxygenating the water and keeping the debris from attaching 
                to the aquarium surface.
            </p>

            <p>experimenting with a aquarium pump showed me that there are a few benefits in regards to my work: oxygenation, first of all, will aid the growth and overall health of the algae. the bubbles also 
                exercise ENOUGH abrupt motion to stimulate them briefly. the nature of the bubbles also makes them disperse semi-randomly, which is very appreciated by both me and the p. lunula. ALSO, something 
                worth noting is that the bubbles still do create a specific sound: the container they’re in vibrates very slightly, and these vibrations should be used.

            <p>Using the bubbles is what I mean by developing around the organisms, rather than inserting them somewhere. it was a solution I would have had to deal with anyways because at my next propagation 
                I’ll have to use very big jars, and i’m excited to see that a “maintenance” solution also can become a “stimulation” solution.
            </p>

            <p>last year i saw the venice biennale, one of the works that surprised me the most was the work in the italian pavillion 
                (extremely rare circumstance!) by Caterina Barbieri, in collaboration with a few organ-building institutions. the work was all about the organs and the ability of air to transport information 
                through vibration. a ‘main’ organ pipe was placed in a room. speakers located at the corners of the room would emit a certain low frequency that would allow the organ pipe to successively vibrate. 
                in another room, other organ pipes (their size was a fraction of the main pipe) would respond to these main vibrations, hence emitting their own frequency too.
            </p>

            <p>a few things worth noting about Barbieri’s piece: there’s a mathematical equation that determines the relationship in size between the main pipe, the smaller pipes, and the “main frequency”. the 
                sound is transmitted through air, so long as the equation is respected, but the differing dimensions of the pipes allow for harmonics of the “main frequency”. the piece itself is all about 
                frequency and intercommunication, and it inspired me largely.

            <p>I’d like to explore the concept of air and frequency and intercommunication. i find that air is a nice element to couple with water due to both being a fluid, and most times behaving similarly. 
                i believe that the specific frequency emitted by the bubbles in a not-full container can be harnessed, IF it has a relation with a container that completely encapsulates both the container with the 
                algae and the bubbles themselves.
            </p>

            <p>to put it in practical terms, I’d like to have a “algae container” consisting of a cylinder. another, larger and empty cylinder would contain the algae container. a aquarium pump would then be 
                inserted in the algae container. the expected outcome would be that, so long as the algae container and the external container (which we call pipe, for ease) have a relation in terms of 
                dimensions, volume and border thickness, a specific sound will be transported and emitted by the pipe. another evolution where this could be taken would involve a system that lowers or rises the 
                algae container vertically, modulating the pitch.

            <p>the idea illustrated above (which, because of logistical and conceptual realizations is subject to change) depicts a schematic of what I’d like to achieve ultimately. the piece can be 
                described by 2 smaller processes, the process that gives air (which we can call ‘lung’) and the process that receives the air (the ‘organ pipe’ inspired body).<br><br> I’ll go ahead and 
                describe each part now (NOTE: the picture shows a user button, probably that won’t be there because I’m reconsidering the option of adding user interaction):
            </p>

            <p>– the lung: initially the idea was to create a sort of “muscle” that would be able to store and release energy (air). my idea initially revolved around using a system of pistons that 
                would dilate and compress a balloon. the lung would also consist of 2 layers, the ‘balloon’ layer, which maintains stability and doesn’t break, and a second layer made by a molded silicone 
                mat that would work as a second skin to the balloon. the idea initially was to inoculate the second skin with nutrients and some mould, and eventually the mould would break down the second 
                skin, showing a sort of ‘dying lung’. I won’t explain the piston system because it would have been too difficult to realise, but a drawing above shows a different method for it: inspired 
                by how pipe organs are made – a large sac of air (called bellows) used to be controlled by a specific person that would push the air into the instrument, while a musician would push the 
                needed notes on the keyboard – i want to make my own bellows mechanism. It would consist of a high-torque motor (20-50kg) with a 5cm gear linking to a 10cm 
                gear. a sliding pin would be attached to the second, larger gear to transform the rotational motion of the gear into a linear motion. 2 valves would be used to control the air’s direction. 
                I’m also ditching the double balloon idea, I’ll instead use a single sac and use its motion and some projection mapping to synthesize the idea of a dying lung. although working with mould 
                was very interesting, i think it needs too much attention, and in general, it’s way too unpredictable.</p>

            <p>– the pipe organ: a flexible tube will direct the lung’s air towards the pipe. the tube would end up inside a smaller jar containing the algae. this smaller jar will be suspended into a 
                transparent PVC tube called harmonizing tube. air would blow into the smaller jar, stressing the algae and creating bubbles. the motion of the bubbles would create a resonance with the 
                harmonizing pipe. a few changes have happened since i’ve finished that schematic shown above: the harmonizing pipe would be suspended too, and I’m considering ditching the idea of raising or 
                lowering the smaller jar. I was hoping that by raising and lowering I could influence the pitch of the harmonics, but the difference is not very noticeable – it would go from a specific 
                tone to pink noise, basically… maybe more experimentation should be done by modulating the openings of the harmonizing pipe IE was thinking about glass bottles, and how clean the tone is 
                when some air is blown at the right angle through the opening. glass bottles usually have a narrower neck, so there’s the possibility that it’s that bottleneck (no pun intended) that allows 
                for more complex harmonics??? anyways, a webcam would be pointed at the jar containing the algae. reading the colour values given off by the stimulated culture can be used to influence the 
                lung, creating a interdependence between the lung and the organ.</p>

            <p>– basically we can see the lung as a representation of effort and decay (or decay during effort). the lung will literally breathe because of the cyclical motion of the gears, providing air 
                to the algae in a sort of self-sacrificing act: as i mentioned above, oxygenating the water can be beneficial to some microalgae, the lung is in fact “helping” the gift of life, the primeval 
                broth represented by the algae, and the algae, in turn, respond, glowing and emitting sound: light and sound are primordial forms of communication. amoebas utilise light and chemical processes 
                in relation to UV light to guide themselves towards nutrition. scientific studies show that the part of our brain responsible for ‘musicality’ forged way before the part responsible of 
                language (actually, the language part is a derivative of that previous musical part). i know i sound like one of those evolutionarists, but i believe that transmission of information is the 
                only real proof of an existing life: it’s the blood flowing through the veins, the motor neurons reaching muscular tissue, the cyclical nature of duplicating and dying cells. exchange and flow 
                of information is the symbol of life itself. SO the lung is responsible for nurturing such life, and as the life “shows” itself it will influence the motion of the lung: too much light, and 
                the mold growing on the lung will increase, too little and the lung will accelerate its breathing. this influence wants to represent the price for life, and how such beauty comes at a cost: 
                resources, energy, effort.</p>

            <p>I’m preparing the next experiment that would decide how I’d use the algae’s glow to influence the mould growth. the webcam part is relatively easy: when placed in a fully dark space, the webcam 
                will capture continuously the state of the algae. when stimulated the algae will produce the blue glow, and the webcam will analyse that colour, alongside the amount of brightness generated 
                (respectively colour and brightness values). I’ve already worked with systems like this one and I’m confident that it will be easy. tomorrow I’ll try to experiment with something like this:
